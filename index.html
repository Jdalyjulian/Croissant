      Did you know that making croissants is the perfect opportunity to practice
      math and science concepts? When creating the dough for croissants, you end
      up practicing multiplication skills. And, as the croissants are baking in
      the oven, you can collect evidence of a chemical reaction. GOT PCL ü•í
      <br />
      <br />
      So, multiplication, what do you mean? Part of the croissant process is
      laminating the dough. This is folding butter into dough many times,
      creating the flakiness of the croissant. To start, you create a dough,
      butter, dough stack. Count that up. How many layers do we have? 3! Ok,
      then roll this out and fold it into thirds. So, 3 x 3 = 9. Time to repeat.
      Roll and fold. 9 x 3 = 27. Time to repeat. Roll and fold. 27 x 3 = 81.
      It's amazing how many layers go into making croissants!
      <br />
      <br />
      What about science? GOT CP is the acronymn for evidence of a chemical
      reaction. Gas, Odor, Temperature, Color, and Precipitate. When you are
      baking, you really don't need to set a timer to know when your pastry is
      ready, just pay attention to GOT CP. When you start to smell the delicous
      aroma of baked goods, that's your cue to pull out the pastry. Go ahead,
      test it with the "clean knife test", it will be perfect. When you do pull
      it out, those flakes that formed are evdience of gas releasing, creating
      pockets in the pastry. And that golden brown color? That's evidence of a
      chemical reaction, too.
